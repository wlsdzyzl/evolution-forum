An old project which can build a forum & blog system. 

The implementation of evolution forum involved servlet, jsp, css, html and javascript. Database is built through MySQL. Server is construncted using tomcat.

People need to register for an account to post and write articles. Many interesting functions were implemented, however, the code is not maintained anymore.
